SIMIYU JOY ABIGAEL – 120
 PRACTICAL ACTIVITY 4:
Email: joy.simiyu@womentechsters.org

Write a shell script to validate password strength when a user enters. Here are a few assumptions for the password string. 
•	Length – minimum of 8 characters. 
•	Contain both alphabet and number. 
•	Include both the small and capital case letters. 
If the password doesn’t comply with any of the above conditions, then the script should report it as a <Weak Password> if the password complies with the conditions, it should echo <Strong Password Secure User> 
	Created a file called practical2.sh where I wrote the code as shown below.

 


	The code above is shown below:
echo "enter the password"
read password
len="${#password}"
if test $len -ge 8 ; then
echo "$password" | grep -q [0-9]

  if test $? -eq 0 ; then
   echo "$password" | grep -q [A-Z]
  if test $? -eq 0 ; then
echo "$password" | grep -q [a-z]   
 if test $? -eq 0 ; then
 echo "Strong password"
  else
  echo "weak password include lower case char"
  fi
 else
echo "weak password include capital char" 
  fi
 else
echo "please include the numbers in password it is weak password"   
fi
else
  echo "password lenght should be greater than or equal 8 hence weak password"
fi
	Below shows different passwords formats tried with their different error messages until user gets the password entered accepted as a strong password.
